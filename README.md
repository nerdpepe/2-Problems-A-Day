As soon as I joined Siemens, I stopped doing problems on platforms like LeetCode, CodeChef and this was a BIG mistake. 
 
So after a lot of months being busy with other (yet important stuff), I decided to take the plunge and start LeetCoding!

## Ꮤ𐋅𐌀𐌕 𐌉 𐌃𐌉𐌃

- I tried doing the LeetCode Daily Challenges
- Was successful for almost a month
- Realized I am weak in basics
- 2 problems took MUCH time of my day

## 𐌍𐌄𐋄𐌕 𐌐𐌋𐌀𐌍

I am now going back to the basics because in order to tackle questions that need some specific data structures I first NEED to know about them. For example, I never knew there was something called a PriorityQueue. WOW

- There are different series that consists of reading material and coding challenges, that cater to noobs like me.
- I am trying to maintain consistency first.
- I am also learning Flutter which is also going on nicely.
